# Weather Undergound Application

- Using API from Weather Underground
- stores location to local storage. If no location is available (local storage empty) it will default to New Albany IN.
- using beta version of materializeCSS. This allows me to drop jQuery from the project.

## API Key
The original API key for development can be found if you browse through the history. This is a none issue as it is a limited use key so no harm no foul.
If you want to test this application further you must supply your own api key...please follow the instructions below.
- [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/), go here make an account and generate Weathe API key (found at bottom of page).
- Rename file `api_SAMPLE.js` to `api_KEY.js`.
- Modify the return value to contain your new api key. 
- Should work at this point as long as the api key is valid.
